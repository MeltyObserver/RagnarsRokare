RagnarsRokare_CraftToStack.readme

These issues has been bothering us long enough.
This is a bugfix mod that will allow you to craft items directly into a stack in your inventory if there is room, no empty slot required.
Craft will also pull resources from the smallest stacks first, freeing up inventory space.

These issues will hopefully be fixed in an upcoming game patch.
 
HEADS UP!
This mod fixes the original game methods when they are loaded.
If other mods blocks the original methods from beeing called then these bugfixes will not work.

Installation:
Copy the RagnarsRokare_CraftToStack.dll-file into the BepInEx pluginfolder and restart Valheim.
Or use Vortex.

The code can be found at https://github.com/di98feja/RagnarsRokare
Please give feedback or sugestions of more bugs that need bashing!

We hope you find this little mod useful!
